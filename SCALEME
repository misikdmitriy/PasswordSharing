System contains 2 elements:
- Dataabse - data storage
- Web - server with HTTP API

1. Ability to vertical scaling:
    Adding procesing power will make server faster. So that HTTP requests would be handled faster.
    System can be scale vertically without any restrictions.

2. Ability to horizontal scaling:
    While new entities (servers) would be added, all servers should still use one database because it is the only central data storage.
    So new entities can be added, but all server should work with one database.
    So that server can be shared between processes and machines.
    Horizontal scheme applied to current server:

    1 Entry point ----> N server machines ---> N server processes ---> 1 database
